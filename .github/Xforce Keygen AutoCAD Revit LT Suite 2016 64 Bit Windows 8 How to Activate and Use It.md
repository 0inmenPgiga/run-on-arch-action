If you have successfully activated AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2016 with Xforce Keygen, you can start using the software to create and edit 2D drawings and 3D models of buildings. AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2016 has many features and tools that can help you with your design and documentation tasks. Here are some of them:

- AutoCAD LT: This is a simplified version of AutoCAD that allows you to create 2D drawings and annotations with precision and accuracy. You can use commands, tools, and menus to draw lines, shapes, dimensions, text, and more. You can also modify and manipulate your drawings with editing tools such as trim, extend, copy, move, rotate, scale, and more. You can also use layers, blocks, hatches, and attributes to organize and manage your drawings.
- Revit LT: This is a simplified version of Revit that allows you to create 3D models of buildings and structures. You can use parametric components, such as walls, doors, windows, roofs, floors, stairs, and more, to create your model. You can also apply materials, colors, textures, and lighting effects to your model. You can also generate views, such as plans, sections, elevations, perspectives, and renderings, from your model. You can also annotate and dimension your views with tags, symbols, notes, and more.
- AutoCAD Revit LT Suite: This is a combination of AutoCAD LT and Revit LT that allows you to work on both 2D drawings and 3D models in a single software package. You can import and export files between AutoCAD LT and Revit LT using the DWG format. You can also link files between AutoCAD LT and Revit LT using the RVT format. This way, you can maintain consistency and coordination between your drawings and models.

AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2016 is a powerful and versatile software package that can help you with your architectural design and documentation projects. However, it is not a substitute for professional training and guidance. Therefore, we recommend that you learn more about the software from official sources such as Autodesk's website or online courses. You can also consult with experts or peers who have experience with the software.
