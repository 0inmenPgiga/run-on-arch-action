- Section 1: Introduction to HTML and DHTML. This section covers the fundamentals of HTML and DHTML, such as tags, attributes, stylesheets, forms, frames, and dynamic elements.
- Section 2: Introduction to JavaScript. This section covers the basics of JavaScript programming, such as variables, operators, functions, objects, events, cookies, and DOM manipulation.
- Section 3: Introduction to Perl CGI. This section covers the basics of Perl programming, such as syntax, data types, control structures, subroutines, modules, file handling, and regular expressions. It also covers how to use Perl CGI to create dynamic web pages and interact with databases.
- Section 4: Advanced Web Development. This section covers some of the advanced topics in web development, such as XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, AJAX, JSON, RESTful web services, security issues, e-commerce applications, and web hosting.

The book is written in a clear and concise style, with plenty of examples and exercises to reinforce the concepts. The book also includes a CD-ROM that contains the source code of all the examples in the book, as well as some useful software tools for web development. The book is suitable for beginners as well as intermediate web developers who want to learn more about the latest web technologies.
  
One of the strengths of this book is that it covers both the client-side and the server-side aspects of web development. The author explains how to use HTML, DHTML, and JavaScript to create interactive and responsive web pages that can communicate with the server using Perl CGI. The author also shows how to use Perl CGI to process user input, validate data, send emails, upload files, and access databases. The book also covers some of the popular web frameworks and libraries that can simplify web development, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS, and React.
 
Another strength of this book is that it covers some of the emerging web technologies that are changing the way web applications are designed and developed. The author introduces the concepts of XML, SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and web services, and explains how they can be used to create interoperable and scalable web applications. The author also demonstrates how to use AJAX, JSON, and RESTful web services to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications that can exchange data with the server without reloading the page. The book also covers some of the security issues and challenges that web developers face, such as cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, SQL injection, and encryption.
 
The book is not without its limitations, however. One of the limitations is that it does not cover some of the newer web technologies that have emerged in recent years, such as HTML5, CSS3, WebSocket, WebRTC, and GraphQL. The book also does not cover some of the advanced topics in web development, such as performance optimization, testing, debugging, deployment, and maintenance. The book also assumes some prior knowledge of programming and web development, and may not be suitable for absolute beginners who have no experience in these fields.
